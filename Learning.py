# this is to display text and it will display a number as well, in this case being 1

# The last line is calculating a large number because I don't have anything I need to calculate at the moment

# a floating point number is a representation of real numbers as an approximation to create a trade off between range and precision. they can be incredibly small or incredibly large numbers.
